- Check if Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

**Frontend won't start:**
- Make sure you're in the frontend folder
- Check if the backend is running first
- Try a different port if 3000 is busy

**AI not working:**

- Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Verify your API key is valid and active

## Customization Ideas
